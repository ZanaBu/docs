## Getting Started with ProgramGenie

ProgramGenie is your AI-powered SDLC assistant that transforms raw project input — documents, designs, and discussions — into fully structured artefacts like project briefs, epics, user stories, and test cases.  

It streamlines the entire software delivery process, integrating seamlessly with platforms like **Jira**, **Confluence**, **Bitbucket**, and **Zephyr**.

## How ProgramGenie Works

ProgramGenie automates the discovery and documentation stages of your project.  
Simply upload your collateral (documents, notes, or code), and Genie generates everything your team needs to move from **idea to implementation** — in minutes.

> 💡 **Tip:** ProgramGenie doesn’t replace your tools — it connects them. Once set up, you can continue working in Jira, Confluence, or Bitbucket, while Genie keeps everything in sync automatically.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export via Connectors">
    Export your artefacts to your preferred platforms for execution and collaboration.

    ### Jira
    - Export **Epics**, **Stories**, and **Subtasks** directly from Genie.

    - Auto-sync ensures updates are reflected in Jira instantly.

    ### Confluence
    - Export **Project Briefs** or documentation pages into Confluence.
    - Maintain project history and team collaboration.

    ### Zephyr

    ### Bitbucket
    - View and summarize repositories directly.
    - Generate artefacts such as **Briefs** or **Epics** from code repositories.

    > 💡 **Tip:** Use the **Export** icon next to each artefact type, or the **Export All** button from your dashboard for batch operations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Work with Repositories">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the Repositories widget">

      </Step>
      <Step title="Use with Chat">
        Open **Genie Chat** and ask context-based questions about the current page, such as “Summarize this article” or “Generate test cases from this documentation.”
      </Step>

    > 💡 **Tip:** Combine Genie Vision with **Connectors** for end-to-end automation — from discovery to documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage Access & Tokens">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Settings → Identity">
        From your profile menu, go to **Settings → Identity**.

        Add users or groups and assign roles like **Admin**, **Editor**, or **Viewer**.
      </Step>

        Manage security by setting expiry dates or revoking access as needed.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    > 🔐 **Important:** Tokens are user-specific — never share them. If a token expires, integrations like Jira or Confluence will pause until renewed.
