Meet **Genie Chat** — your conversational interface to ProgramGenie.  
It allows you to **talk to Genie like a teammate**, not a tool.

You can create artefacts, ask questions, regenerate documentation, or explore dependencies — all by typing or speaking naturally.

<Tip>Think of Genie Chat as your bridge between human intent and automated delivery.</Tip>

## Why Genie Chat Matters

Traditional SDLC tools require navigation through menus, filters, and configuration screens. Genie Chat removes that friction.

**With Genie Chat, you can:**
- Generate new artefacts instantly (“Create a user story for password reset”).  
- Update existing content (“Change all references of ‘account’ to ‘profile’”).  
- Ask for insights (“Show me stories linked to failed tests”).  
- Get help (“Explain what this Epic covers in simple terms”).  

It’s conversational, fast, and context-aware — built to understand your project’s structure, relationships, and priorities.

## What You Can Do

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Generate Artefacts">

    Example: “Generate 5 user stories for the new billing flow.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Modify or Extend">

    Example: “Add acceptance criteria to the login story.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Query Project Data">
    Explore your project’s structure and state.  
    Example: “Show me all stories missing test cases.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Summarize or Explain">

## Real Conversations, Real Results

Here’s how teams typically use Genie Chat in daily workflows:

| **Scenario** | **Prompt** | **Outcome** |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Create documentation | “Generate a project brief for the new HR portal.” | Genie creates a structured brief with epics and key requirements. |
| Update artefacts | “Rename ‘employee portal’ to ‘staff portal’ across all stories.” | Genie updates artefacts automatically and syncs changes to Jira. |
| Explore coverage | “List all stories without test cases.” | Genie filters and displays missing test coverage instantly. |
| Review scope | “Show me what’s included in the Onboarding Epic.” | Genie presents related stories, tasks, and test cases. |

<Note>Every chat command can trigger updates across your connected platforms — Jira, Confluence, Zephyr, and more — ensuring consistent and synchronized documentation.</Note>

## Best Practices

> - Be specific with your commands — Genie understands context, but clarity improves results.  
> - Use short, action-oriented phrasing (e.g., “Add,” “Generate,” “List,” “Update”).  
> - Review generated artefacts before final approval or publishing.  
> - Combine multiple instructions in one message if they relate to the same artefact.  
> - Save frequent prompts as macros or shortcuts in your workspace.

<Tip>The more you use Genie Chat, the better it adapts to your project’s tone, terminology, and structure.</Tip>

## Example Use Case

A **QA Manager** joins a sprint review and needs to check alignment between requirements and tests.  
Instead of navigating through menus, they simply type:  
> “Show me test cases not linked to any user story.”  

Genie instantly lists the results, identifies duplicates, and offers to generate missing links.  
Minutes later, the QA Manager exports the findings to Jira — without ever leaving the chat.
