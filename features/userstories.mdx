title: "User Stories"
---
Every project lives or dies by how well requirements are translated into action.  
**User Stories** are where that translation becomes crystal clear.  

ProgramGenie transforms business intent, design cues, and collateral into structured, developer-ready stories — each one written in a consistent format, linked to its Epic, and paired with test coverage.

> **In short:** Genie turns “what we want to build” into “what we need to do.”

## The Standard User Story Format

Each story generated by Genie follows a simple, universally understood structure:

| **Field** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Title** | Short, action-oriented summary | *User Login and Authentication* |
| **As a…** | The role or persona performing the action | *As a registered user…* |
| **I want to…** | The goal or action the user needs to complete | *I want to log in using my credentials…* |
| **So that…** | The reason or business value behind the action | *So that I can securely access my dashboard.* |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | The testable conditions for success | *Given valid credentials → access granted; given invalid → error message shown.* |
| **Linked Artefacts** | Connected items for full traceability | *Epic: Authentication / Test Case: Login Flow* |

## From Input to Story in Seconds

Unlike manual documentation, Genie’s process doesn’t start from a blank page.  
Here’s how it works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Understand Intent">
    Genie reads your uploaded collateral — proposals, notes, mockups — to understand what the feature is meant to achieve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Identify User Goals">
    It extracts user intentions, actions, and roles from that content automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Generate Stories">
    Each goal is turned into a properly formatted user story, complete with acceptance criteria.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Link Everything Together">
    Genie connects the story with its parent Epic, relevant test cases, and source references — all traceable and synchronized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why It Matters

When your stories are structured and connected from the start, you eliminate the biggest blockers in delivery: ambiguity, duplication, and rework.

**Benefits at a glance:**
- Alignment across business, QA, and dev teams  
- Consistent structure across projects  
- Real-time updates from Genie to Jira  
- Reusable knowledge base for future initiatives  

<Note>Traditional teams spend 30–50% of discovery time writing and rewriting user stories. With Genie, that work happens automatically — and accurately — in minutes.</Note>

## Example Output

Here’s an example of a Genie-generated story for a banking app:

<Tip>
Epic: Account Management  
User Story: As a user, I want to view my transaction history so that I can track my spending.  

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am logged in, when I navigate to “My Transactions,” I see my past transactions.  
- Transactions are sorted by date (latest first).  
- I can filter transactions by amount, type, or date.  
- I can export transactions as a CSV file.  

Linked Test Case: Verify transaction history visibility and filtering.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Treat user stories as living artefacts — update and regenerate as scope evolves.  
- Keep one action per story for clarity.  
- Review acceptance criteria collaboratively with QA.  
- Use meaningful titles — “User Login and MFA” is better than “Login Function.”  
- Regularly sync with Jira for up-to-date tracking.

<Tip>The best stories read like conversations, not specs. Genie’s natural-language structure helps every team member understand what’s being built and why.</Tip>
