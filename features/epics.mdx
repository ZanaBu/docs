title: "Epics"
---
Every great project starts with a big picture — the “what” before the “how.”  
**Epics** in ProgramGenie give that picture structure.

When Genie analyzes your input, it automatically groups related features, functions, and user goals into Epics.  
Each Epic becomes a logical container that connects **user stories**, **subtasks**, and **test cases** — turning complex requirements into an organized, traceable hierarchy.

<Tip>Epics help everyone speak the same language — business teams, developers, and QA all see the same structure and intent.</Tip>

---

## Why It Matters

Epics bridge the gap between *strategy* and *execution*.  
They let stakeholders visualize the full scope of delivery, while helping teams plan and prioritize efficiently.

**Key advantages:**
- **Structure and clarity:** Group related work under clear, named Epics.  
- **Traceability:** Each Epic links directly to its originating collateral and generated stories.  
- **Planning readiness:** Perfect for sprint planning, backlog refinement, and roadmap visualization.  
- **Progress tracking:** Managers can monitor completion rates at the Epic level.  
- **Scalability:** As projects grow, new features slot naturally into existing Epics.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Generation from Collateral">
    Genie analyzes all project inputs and automatically detects themes, functions, and business objectives — each one forming the basis for a potential Epic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Epic Creation">
    Using these insights, Genie creates Epics with descriptive titles and summaries.  
    Each Epic includes links to the user stories and test cases that belong to it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Review and Adjust">
    You can rename, merge, or split Epics directly in Genie. Adjust descriptions, add acceptance criteria, or define business value before syncing with Jira or other tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Sync and Manage">
    Once finalized, Epics sync automatically to your chosen platform (e.g., Jira). Teams can then plan sprints, track progress, and report directly against them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Epic Structure Example

| **Section** | **Description** | **Example** |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Epic Title** | Defines the main theme or goal. | *User Authentication & Access Management* |
| **Summary** | A short, outcome-focused description. | *Enable users to register, log in, and recover passwords securely.* |
| **Business Value** | The “why” behind the Epic. | *Improves user retention and supports compliance.* |
| **Linked Stories** | Automatically generated, traceable requirements. | *Login Flow, Password Reset, MFA Setup* |
| **Linked Test Cases** | QA artefacts derived from each story. | *Verify login flow with valid/invalid credentials.* |

<Tip>Epics are living structures — update them anytime as Genie regenerates stories or scope evolves.</Tip>

## Best Practices

> - Treat each Epic as a business outcome, not just a technical module.  
> - Keep Epic descriptions focused on *value* rather than implementation.  
> - Merge small, overlapping Epics to avoid redundancy.  
> - Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., “Payment Gateway Integration”).  
> - Review links between stories and Epics regularly for traceability.

## Example Use Case

A **telecom provider** uploads discovery notes and requirement documents for a self-care portal.  
Genie automatically identifies four main Epics:  
**User Management, Billing & Payments, Support Chat, and Usage Analytics.**

Each Epic contains a set of **user stories** and **test cases**, ready for export to Jira.  
The delivery team now has a structured backlog aligned with client priorities — built in minutes.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Can I create or edit Epics manually?">
    Yes. While Genie auto-generates Epics, you can also create them manually, edit names, or merge multiple Epics from the UI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Genie follow any standard naming convention for Epics?">
    By default, Genie uses concise, functional names (e.g., “Payments Module” or “User Authentication”). You can customize naming rules in your organization settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are Epics connected to user stories and test cases?">
    Each Epic serves as a parent entity linking all related artefacts. Changes in stories or test cases automatically propagate to the corresponding Epic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export Epics to Jira or other tools?">
    Yes. Epics sync automatically to your connected platform (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps), preserving hierarchy and traceability.
