title: "Subtasks"
---
Once your **User Stories** define what needs to be built, **Subtasks** define how it gets done.  
They represent the smallest actionable units within ProgramGenie’s hierarchy — concrete steps that developers, testers, or designers can pick up and complete.

Genie automatically creates and links subtasks under each user story, breaking down complex work into manageable pieces.  
This helps teams plan better, execute faster, and maintain visibility across all delivery stages.

<Tip>Subtasks bring the big picture down to the ground — ensuring every task, no matter how small, contributes to the larger outcome.</Tip>

## Why Subtasks Matter

In large projects, user stories can quickly become too broad for day-to-day tracking.  
Subtasks solve that by dividing effort clearly across people and teams.

**Key benefits:**
- **Granularity:** Translate user stories into specific, actionable work items.  
- **Accountability:** Assign tasks directly to team members.  
- **Traceability:** Every subtask inherits context from its parent story and Epic.  
- **Clarity:** Keeps sprint boards organized and focused on tangible progress.  
- **Automation:** Genie generates subtasks automatically based on dependencies and test coverage.

## From Story to Subtask

Here’s how Genie breaks down a user story into detailed subtasks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Identify Work Units">
    Genie scans each user story to identify distinct technical actions or deliverables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Generate Subtasks Automatically">
    Each action becomes a structured subtask, complete with title, description, and linkage to the parent story.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Assign and Sync">
    Once generated, subtasks can be assigned to team members and automatically synced to Jira or Azure DevOps for execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Track Progress">
    Subtasks update in real time, rolling up progress to their parent story for accurate reporting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subtask Structure Example

| **Field** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Title** | The task to perform | *Implement login API endpoint* |
| **Parent Story** | The related user story | *As a user, I want to log in securely...* |
| **Description** | Short explanation of the action | *Develop the authentication endpoint using OAuth2.* |
| **Assignee** | The team member responsible | *Backend Developer* |
| **Dependencies** | Linked items or blockers | *Database schema migration* |
| **Status** | Tracks progress | *To Do / In Progress / Done* |

## Example Output

Here’s an example of subtasks generated for a user story within a banking application:

<Tip> 
User Story: As a user, I want to transfer funds between accounts so that I can manage my finances.
Generated Subtasks:
- Design transfer flow API (Backend)
- Create transaction validation rules (Backend)
- Implement transfer form (Frontend)
- Add input validation for amount field (Frontend)
- Write test case: Verify successful transfer (QA)
</Tip>

Each subtask remains fully linked to its parent story and Epic, ensuring that the chain of traceability — from business goal to technical action — is never broken.

## Best Practices

- Keep subtasks small and specific — ideally completable within a day or two.  
- Assign subtasks to owners early to avoid delivery gaps.  
- Use consistent naming (e.g., “Implement,” “Create,” “Write test for”).  
- Regularly review and clean up redundant or duplicate subtasks.  
- Track progress through the board view for full transparency.  

<Tip>Think of subtasks as micro-commitments — clear, achievable pieces of progress that together build momentum.</Tip>

## Example Use Case

A **software house** receives a client request for a payment gateway module.  
Genie generates stories and test cases automatically, then breaks each story into actionable subtasks for backend, frontend, and QA teams.  
When synced to Jira, every developer instantly sees their assigned items — already categorized and linked to the broader project scope.
