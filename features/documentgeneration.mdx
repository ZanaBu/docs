title: "Document Generation"
---
This is where the magic happens. ✨  
With **Document Generation**, ProgramGenie transforms your uploaded collateral into clear, structured, and traceable artefacts — in minutes, not weeks.

Whether you start with a rough brief, scattered notes, or legacy documentation, Genie reads your input, identifies intent, and produces everything your delivery team needs — from high-level project briefs to detailed user stories and test cases.

<Tip>Genie doesn’t just generate documents — it builds understanding. Every word is grounded in your real project data, ensuring accuracy and relevance.</Tip>

## Why It Matters

Software projects fail or stall most often in the discovery and documentation phase — when ideas are being translated into technical language.  
Document Generation eliminates that bottleneck by producing artefacts that are instantly useful for development, testing, and management.

**Key benefits:**
- **Speed:** Generate project documentation in minutes instead of weeks.  
- **Consistency:** Every artefact follows your organization’s structure and industry standards.  
- **Traceability:** Each element is linked back to its originating collateral.  
- **Alignment:** Business, QA, and dev teams share a single, accurate view of scope and requirements.  
- **Compliance:** All generated outputs are versioned, reviewable, and audit-friendly.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Feed Genie Your Collateral">
    Upload project materials — documents, designs, videos, or notes. Genie ingests and analyzes them to build understanding of scope and intent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Select What You Want to Generate">
    Choose from project briefs, epics, user stories, test cases, or all of the above. Genie automatically selects the most relevant content and structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Review and Approve">
    Instantly preview the generated artefacts. You can edit, refine, or regenerate sections to fit your preferred language or format.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Sync with Your Tools">
    Once approved, publish directly to Jira, Confluence, Azure DevOps, or your connected systems — ready for team use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

> Document Generation turns your raw input into structured, actionable documentation — automatically formatted, interconnected, and ready for delivery.

## Artefacts You Can Generate

| **Artefact Type** | **Purpose** | **Example Output** |
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Project Brief** | A concise overview capturing business objectives, goals, and scope. | “Mobile banking app for SME clients — phase 1 MVP.” |
| **Epics** | High-level functional areas organizing user stories. | “User Authentication,” “Transaction Management.” |
| **User Stories** | Actionable requirements written from the user’s perspective. | “As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access easily.” |
| **Subtasks** | Granular technical actions linked to user stories. | “Implement password reset API.” |
| **Test Cases** | Manual or automated validation steps. | Gherkin-format acceptance criteria for QA teams. |
| **Wireframes** | Basic visual representations of described features. | Automatically generated low-fidelity mockups. |

## Best Practices

> - Start with clear and complete collateral — Genie’s accuracy improves with richer inputs.  
> - Always review the generated brief first; it sets the tone for all subsequent artefacts.  
> - Use version control to keep track of regenerations.  
> - Align your generated outputs with your organization’s terminology before publishing.  
> - Use Genie’s connectors to push content to Jira or other systems for real-time collaboration.

<Tip>Genie learns from every iteration. Reviewing and approving generated artefacts helps refine future generations automatically.</Tip>

## Example Use Case

A telecom client uploads an RFP, an internal requirements sheet, and several screenshots.  
Within minutes, Genie generates a detailed **project brief**, a structured list of **epics** and **user stories**, and a complete set of **test cases** linked to each story.  
The client approves the documentation in a review call, and the entire package syncs instantly with Jira — ready for development.
