title: "Wireframes"
---
Sometimes words aren’t enough.  
**Wireframes** in ProgramGenie give your ideas shape — transforming text, user stories, or even images into simple, structured visual layouts.

Whether you’re validating a new concept, aligning with clients, or accelerating design-to-development workflows, Genie’s wireframe generation bridges the gap between requirements and visualization.

<Tip>If you can describe it, Genie can visualize it.</Tip>

## Why Wireframes Matter

Before any code is written, alignment on what’s being built is crucial.  
Wireframes help teams validate functionality, layout, and user flow early — minimizing rework and confusion later in the cycle.

**Key benefits:**
- **Instant Visualization:** Generate mockups from text or design collateral.  
- **Cross-Team Alignment:** Designers, developers, and business users can see the same concept.  
- **Reduced Rework:** Catch usability or scope gaps before implementation.  
- **Traceability:** Wireframes link directly to their originating stories and requirements.  
- **Faster Sign-Off:** Clients and stakeholders can review visual outputs early.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Gather Inputs">
    Genie uses your project’s collateral — descriptions, user stories, or design notes — as the foundation for visualization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Generate Layout">
    Based on textual and contextual understanding, Genie produces low-fidelity wireframes that reflect user flow, components, and screen hierarchy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Review and Iterate">
    You can refine layouts, adjust element positioning, or regenerate sections with new prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Export and Sync">
    Export generated wireframes as images, embed them in documentation, or link them to related user stories and test cases.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Output

Here’s an example of how Genie turns a text prompt into a wireframe concept:

> **Prompt:**  
> “A login page with username and password fields, a ‘Remember Me’ checkbox, and a ‘Forgot Password’ link.”

Resulting wireframe:  
🖼️ *Login screen mockup showing input fields, CTA button, and secondary links.*

<Note>The wireframes are not final UI designs — they are structured visual blueprints that help you validate concepts before high-fidelity design begins.</Note>

## Supported Input Types

| **Input Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Text Prompts** | Describe the screen or flow you want to visualize. | “A checkout page with order summary and payment button.” |
| **User Stories** | Genie extracts layout logic directly from story steps. | “As a user, I want to edit my profile picture.” |
| **Images / Sketches** | Upload a mockup or drawing; Genie interprets layout and generates corresponding wireframes. | Photo of a whiteboard sketch. |
| **Figma / Design Notes** | Optional — paste structured design text or notes for richer results. | “Use two-column layout for desktop.” |

## Best Practices

> - Use clear and specific prompts (e.g., “mobile dashboard with summary cards” instead of “a nice dashboard”).  
> - Combine multiple user stories to generate complete flows.  
> - Use Genie Vision to interpret existing designs or screenshots.  
> - Iterate — wireframes can be regenerated until they reflect the right structure.  
> - Link wireframes to stories and Epics for full context traceability.

<Tip>Wireframes are best used for alignment — not perfection. The goal is clarity, not color.</Tip>
