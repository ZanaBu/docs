title: "Repositories"
---
Every artefact your team creates — requirements, stories, test cases, or wireframes — holds value.  
**Repositories** make sure that value never gets lost.

Genie’s Repositories feature is your **central knowledge base**, allowing teams to store, reuse, and version-control generated artefacts across multiple projects, clients, and domains.

<Note>Think of it as your organization’s internal “Genie Hub” — where delivery intelligence grows with every project.</Note>

## Why Repositories Matter

In most organizations, knowledge is scattered — stuck in individual projects, people’s folders, or different tools.  
Genie Repositories solve that by creating **a unified, searchable library** of every artefact your teams produce.

**Key benefits:**
- **Reuse:** Clone proven artefacts from previous projects instead of starting from scratch.  
- **Governance:** Ensure all project materials align with company standards and compliance.  
- **Traceability:** Link reused artefacts back to their origins for audit or optimization.  
- **Scalability:** Roll out best practices across multiple teams or clients effortlessly.  
- **Continuity:** Retain knowledge even when people change roles or leave the company.  

<Tip>Every artefact you generate is an investment — Repositories make sure you earn compound interest on it.</Tip>

## Repository Structure

Repositories are organized to reflect your SDLC hierarchy:

| **Level** | **Contains** | **Example** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Projects** | Groupings of related artefacts (Epics, Stories, Tests) | *Mobile Banking App, Claims Portal* |
| **Collections** | Artefact groups by domain or function | *Authentication, Payments, Notifications* |
| **Artefacts** | Individual reusable items | *“Login flow” story, “OTP verification” test case* |
| **Versions** | Historical snapshots of each artefact | *v1.0 Initial Release, v1.1 Compliance Update* |

<Note>All artefacts are traceable across versions and projects — you can always see where and how something was reused.</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Store">
    Every time you publish or finalize artefacts, Genie automatically stores them in your repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Search">
    Use filters or natural language search to find artefacts by name, type, or context.  
    Example: “Show me all payment test cases used in banking projects.”
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Reuse">
    Import artefacts into a new project and adapt them automatically to the new context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Version & Govern">
    Genie tracks every change, ensuring your organization maintains a complete audit trail.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Use Case

A **government IT provider** completes a citizen services portal project and stores all artefacts in Genie’s Repository.  
When a new e-services portal starts, the team imports 60% of the artefacts from the previous repository — instantly adapting language, fields, and roles.  
The project launches in half the usual time, with full traceability for compliance.

## Best Practices

> - Tag artefacts with business domains (e.g., “Banking”, “Telecom”) for easy discovery.  
> - Regularly review and archive outdated versions to keep repositories clean.  
> - Assign repository owners to maintain naming conventions and structure.  
> - Reuse verified artefacts wherever possible — it improves consistency and reduces delivery risk.  
> - Leverage Genie’s versioning to track contributions and reuse analytics.

<Tip>The more projects you complete with Genie, the smarter your repository becomes — it learns what excellence looks like.</Tip>

## Governance & Security

Genie Repositories support enterprise-grade governance features:

- **Role-based access control** — ensure only authorized users can view or modify artefacts.  
- **Audit logs** — track who accessed or edited repository content.  
- **Compliance tagging** — mark artefacts linked to specific regulations or frameworks (e.g., GDPR, ISO).  
- **Version locks** — freeze verified artefacts for certification or external audits.

<Note>Repositories don’t just store artefacts — they store accountability.</Note>
