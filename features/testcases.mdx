title: "Test Cases"
---
Every requirement deserves proof that it works as intended.  
**Test Cases** in ProgramGenie provide that proof — automatically.  

From the moment user stories and requirements are generated, Genie builds a complete suite of test cases aligned with each story’s acceptance criteria.  
These cases are written in **industry-standard formats** like Gherkin, traceable across artefacts, and instantly exportable to tools like **Zephyr**, **Jira**, or **Azure DevOps**.

<Tip>Testing shouldn’t start after development — with Genie, it starts the moment your stories are written.</Tip>

## Why Test Cases Matter

Testing is often where project delays and quality issues surface. Manual creation of test cases is slow, repetitive, and error-prone.  
Genie automates this process — delivering complete, structured, and traceable validation coverage instantly.

**Key benefits:**
- **Speed:** Auto-generate test cases in seconds instead of weeks.  
- **Coverage:** Every story gets linked validation steps from day one.  
- **Traceability:** Test cases connect directly to user stories and Epics.  
- **Reusability:** Standardized test case templates can be reused across projects.  
- **Compliance:** Creates auditable proof of requirement validation.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Analyse Requirements">
    Genie reviews your collateral, user stories, and acceptance criteria to extract validation logic and expected behaviors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Generate Test Cases">
    Each requirement is paired with one or more test cases, written in natural language or Gherkin format, ready for manual or automated execution.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Link and Sync">
    Generated test cases are automatically linked to the relevant user stories and Epics. You can sync them directly to Jira, Zephyr, or other integrated tools.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Validate and Iterate">
    Review, refine, or regenerate test cases as requirements evolve. Genie ensures all updates propagate automatically across linked artefacts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test Case Structure Example

| **Field** | **Description** | **Example** |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| **ID** | Unique identifier assigned by Genie | *TC-101* |
| **Linked Story** | The user story this case validates | *As a user, I want to log in securely…* |
| **Title** | Short, descriptive name of the test | *Verify login with valid credentials* |
| **Preconditions** | Setup or requirements before execution | *User account must exist and be active* |
| **Test Steps** | Actions to perform | *Enter username → Enter password → Click Login* |
| **Expected Result** | What should happen if functionality works | *User is redirected to the dashboard* |
| **Type** | Manual / Automated | *Automated* |
| **Framework** | Test framework or format | *Gherkin / Cucumber* |

## Example Output (Gherkin Format)

Feature: Login Functionality

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
  - Given a registered user with a valid account
  - When the user enters a correct username and password
  - And clicks the "Login" button
  - Then the user is redirected to their dashboard
  - And a welcome message is displayed

Each test case is automatically tied back to its originating story, collateral, and Epic — ensuring full traceability and eliminating gaps in validation.

## Why QA Teams Love It

- **Eliminates duplication:** No more copying requirements into test tools.  
- **Ensures alignment:** Every test case reflects the latest version of the story.  
- **Improves efficiency:** QA can begin work earlier, parallel to development.  
- **Enables reuse:** Standardized test logic across similar systems or modules.  
- **Supports automation:** Outputs are compatible with automated testing frameworks.  

<Note>By linking requirements, stories, and test cases, Genie transforms testing from a reactive activity into a proactive quality assurance process.</Note>

## Best Practices

- Always review generated acceptance criteria before running test generation.  
- Group test cases logically (by feature or Epic) to simplify maintenance.  
- Use Genie’s integrations to push tests into your preferred QA platform.  
- Regenerate cases when user stories change — updates cascade automatically.  
- Track test coverage from within Genie or Jira to ensure 100% visibility.  

<Tip>Think of Genie’s test cases as your first line of defense — preventing bugs, misalignment, and missed requirements before code is written.</Tip>
