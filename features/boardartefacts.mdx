title: "Board (Artefacts View)"
---

Once Genie generates your artefacts — from Epics to Test Cases — you need a place to see it all come together.  
That’s where the **Board (Artefacts View)** comes in.

The Artefacts Board is a dynamic workspace that visualizes your entire project in a clean, **Kanban-style interface**.  
It’s not just a list — it’s a living map of your software delivery lifecycle.

<Tip>The Board gives you a single, real-time view of progress, dependencies, and quality across all artefacts — from idea to release.</Tip>

## Why the Board Matters

Visibility is everything.  
Even the most automated documentation needs a way to be tracked, reviewed, and updated collaboratively.  
The Board transforms Genie’s generated artefacts into a **manageable, interactive workflow**.

**Key benefits:**
- **Unified View:** See all your Epics, User Stories, Subtasks, and Test Cases in one place.  
- **Real-Time Sync:** Any change in Genie (or connected tools like Jira) is reflected instantly.  
- **Traceability:** Click any card to view linked stories, requirements, or test cases.  
- **Collaboration:** Assign tasks, review progress, or trigger regenerations directly from the board.  
- **Governance:** Perfect for sprint reviews, QA tracking, and compliance validation.

## Board Layout Overview

| **Column** | **Purpose** | **Example Cards** |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Epics** | High-level project goals and deliverables. | *User Authentication, Billing Integration* |
| **User Stories** | Individual functional requirements. | *As a user, I want to log in securely…* |
| **Subtasks** | Detailed work items under each story. | *Implement OAuth2 token validation* |
| **Test Cases** | Linked validation items ensuring coverage. | *Verify login with invalid password* |

<Note>Each artefact card includes metadata such as status, assignee, creation date, and cross-links to ensure full traceability.</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Automatic Population">
    When Genie generates project artefacts, they automatically appear on the Board, categorized by type (Epic, Story, Subtask, Test Case).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Interactive Controls">
    Drag and drop items across columns, assign owners, or update statuses directly within the interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Cross-Link Navigation">
    Clicking any artefact opens its details — including related items, test coverage, and change history.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Real-Time Sync">
    The Board stays synced with external tools like Jira and Confluence, ensuring alignment across platforms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow

A **banking team** uses Genie to generate requirements and test cases for a new mobile app module.  
As artefacts are created, they appear on the Board automatically:

- Epics define major milestones: *Onboarding, Transactions, Notifications*  
- User stories fill each Epic: *As a user, I want to transfer funds securely.*  
- Subtasks organize technical work for each story.  
- Test cases track validation status in real time.  

During sprint planning, the manager filters by Epic to review progress, checks test completion rates, and exports a board summary directly to stakeholders.

## Best Practices

> - Review your Board daily for progress and blockers.  
> - Use filtering to focus on key Epics or sprints.  
> - Keep artefact naming consistent across all levels.  
> - Leverage color codes or tags to differentiate artefact types.  
> - Archive completed Epics to maintain focus on active work.

<Tip>The Board isn’t just for visibility — it’s a control center. Every artefact remains live, traceable, and regenerable directly from this view.</Tip>

## Example Use Case

A **telecom operator** manages 200+ artefacts for a customer portal project.  
Using the Board, they can instantly view which features are complete, which are under QA, and which need rework — all synchronized with Jira.  
The QA team filters by “Failed Tests” while developers see open subtasks per sprint, creating a single source of truth for delivery.
