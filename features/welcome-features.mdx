## Dive Deeper

ProgramGenie isn’t just another documentation tool — it’s your AI co-pilot for the entire software delivery lifecycle. Each feature is designed to solve real-world delivery challenges: slow discovery, scattered artefacts, manual test writing, and lost context between teams.  

Together, these features create a single, intelligent workflow — from raw input to ready-to-build requirements — faster, clearer, and fully traceable.

## The Core Features That Make ProgramGenie Unique
Every part of ProgramGenie was designed with one purpose — to remove the friction between idea and implementation. What follows isn’t a list of tools, but a set of building blocks that help teams deliver faster, with clarity and confidence.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Collateral">
    Every project starts with chaos — folders, docs, screenshots, and meeting notes everywhere.  
    **Collateral** is where that chaos turns into clarity. Upload or link all your project inputs — documents, designs, URLs, videos, even handwritten notes.  
    Genie analyzes everything and builds the foundation for what comes next.  
    <Tip>Nothing gets lost — every detail becomes part of a living, structured knowledge base.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Generation">
    This is where the magic happens. Genie reads your collateral and instantly turns it into **project briefs, epics, user stories, and test cases** — written in clear, industry-standard language.  
    <Tip>What used to take weeks of workshops, alignment meetings, and manual writing now takes minutes — consistent, complete, and ready for review.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Epics">
    Genie automatically organizes your project into **epics** — the big themes or deliverables that define scope.  
    Each epic becomes a container for all related user stories and test cases.  
    <Tip>Gives you a bird’s-eye view of structure and progress from day one.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="User Stories">
    Turn business intent into action. Genie creates **user-centric stories** with acceptance criteria and links to test coverage.  
    They’re written in the structured format developers and testers already use.  
    <Tip>Clear, actionable stories — no rewriting, no translation, no confusion.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Subtasks">
    Sometimes you need to break things down further. Genie can generate **subtasks** under each user story, helping teams plan execution at a granular level.  
    <Tip>Brings clarity and accountability to every step of delivery.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Cases">
    Genie doesn’t stop at what to build — it helps you confirm you’re building the right thing.  
    Automatically generate **manual or automated test cases**, linked directly to each story and written in frameworks like Gherkin.  
    <Tip>Full coverage, zero guesswork — QA can start validating from day one.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Wireframes">
    If you can describe it, Genie can visualize it.  
    Generate **wireframes and simple mockups** directly from requirements or collateral.  
    <Tip>Teams and clients can see what they’re getting before a single line of code is written.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Repositories">
    Your central library for everything Genie generates.  
    Browse, reuse, and version-control artefacts across projects. Perfect for large organizations or repeat product lines.  
    <Tip>Save time and keep standards — your best work becomes reusable templates for future projects.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Board (Artefacts View)">
    A clean, Kanban-style board that visualizes all your artefacts — epics, stories, subtasks, and test cases — in one place.  
    <Tip>Instant visibility for everyone — managers track progress, developers see dependencies, testers plan validation.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Genie Chat">
    Talk to Genie like you’d talk to a colleague.  
    Ask questions, request artefacts, or make changes in natural language — for example:  
    “Add a login error test case.”  
    “Show me all requirements mentioning payment.”  
    <Tip>The fastest way to collaborate with your AI teammate — no menus, no friction.</Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Genie Vision">
    Drop in a screenshot, diagram, or UI mockup — Genie Vision understands the image and generates the relevant user stories or test cases automatically.  
    <Tip>Turns design into development — instantly bridging the gap between UX and requirements.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
