## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What is ProgramGenie?">
    ProgramGenie is an AI-powered SDLC automation platform that turns your project collateral into structured deliverables — from project briefs to test cases — all connected through automation and traceability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create a new project?">
    Go to the **Projects Dashboard**, click **New Project**, give it a name, and upload collateral (documents, designs, or URLs).  
    Genie will analyze the inputs and make them ready for artefact generation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What types of collateral can I upload?">
    You can upload documents (PDF, DOCX), images (PNG, JPG), URLs, and plain text.  
    Everything becomes searchable and linkable in your project’s knowledge base.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit artefacts after generating them?">
    Yes. You can edit any artefact directly in Genie.  
    Edits are synced automatically with connected systems like Jira or TestRail.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I duplicate projects or artefacts?">
    Yes — use the **Duplicate Message** or **Clone Artefact** icons to replicate prompts or existing items.
  </Accordion>

## Connectors & Integrations

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Which integrations are available?">
    ProgramGenie supports the following integrations:
    - **Jira** and **Confluence** (Atlassian ecosystem)  
    - **Azure DevOps (ADO)**  
    - **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket** (source control)  
    - **Zephyr**, **Xray**, and **TestRail** (test management)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I connect Jira or Confluence?">
    In **Settings → Connectors → Add Connector**, select Jira or Confluence.  
    Enter your domain (e.g. `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`), email, and API token.  
    Genie verifies the connection automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple connectors?">
    Yes. You can connect multiple instances — even two Jira or GitLab repositories in the same project.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does my connector show an error?">
    - The API token might have expired.  
    - The connected account may lack permissions.  
    - The repository or project key may be invalid.  
    Recreate the token, check access rights, and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do Jira and Confluence use the same token?">
    Yes. Atlassian tokens can be shared across Jira and Confluence, provided they are created by the same account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Genie automatically create repositories or projects?">
    Yes. If the configured repository or project does not exist in Jira, Confluence, or ADO, ProgramGenie will create it automatically during setup.
  </Accordion>

## Artefacts & Automation

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What are artefacts in ProgramGenie?">
    Artefacts are structured outputs generated by Genie — including briefs, epics, user stories, test cases, and wireframes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I generate artefacts?">
    Open a project → Upload collateral → Click **Generate Brief** → then **Generate Epics** → then **Generate User Stories** or **Test Cases**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the difference between epics, stories, and sub-tasks?">
    - **Epics**: High-level deliverables.  
    - **Stories**: Functional units derived from epics.  
    - **Sub-tasks**: Specific work actions linked to stories.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I generate multiple versions of an artefact?">
    Yes. Use **Generate Multiple Versions** to compare different content drafts and select the best one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my generation output seems incomplete?">
    Ensure the collateral is complete and relevant. Try **Regenerate** or adjust the prompt context for more detailed output.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are artefacts linked to each other?">
    Genie maintains a parent-child hierarchy — linking briefs → epics → stories → test cases — ensuring full traceability.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Chat, Prompting & AI Editing

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="How does ProgramGenie Chat work?">
    ProgramGenie Chat is context-aware and references all artefacts and collateral in your project.  
    Ask it to summarize, generate, or modify items using simple prompts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are 'Human in the Loop' prompts?">
    These are interactive prompts where Genie asks clarifying questions before generating final output — ideal for complex decisions like “Help decide which artefacts to generate first.”
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is AI-supported editing?">
    When editing an artefact, highlight text and choose one of the following:
    - **Simplify:** Make content easier to read.  
    - **Shorten:** Remove unnecessary words.  
    - **Lengthen:** Expand and elaborate.  
    - **Fix:** Correct typos and structure.  
    You can also write custom prompts for tailored edits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use prompts that refer to other artefacts?">
    Yes. You can reference any artefact or collateral in prompts.  
    Example: “Summarize all stories under the Login epic.”
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Genie support creative or analytical prompts?">
    Absolutely. Use **creative prompts** for generating documentation or scripts, and **analytical prompts** for comparing artefacts or summarizing differences.
  </Accordion>

## Dashboard, Widgets & Vision

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What are widgets?">
    Widgets organize content in your dashboard — like Documents, Epics, Test Cases, Wireframes, and Repositories.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I resize or rearrange widgets?">
    Yes. You can resize, minimize, or move widgets using drag-and-drop or the gear icon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does the Board Artefacts widget do?">
    It provides a structured hierarchy view showing all artefacts — from briefs to test cases — in one place.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Genie Vision?">
    Genie Vision allows the chat to “see” live web pages in your browser.  
    Install the **Genie Vision Extension**, then use `@Tab` in chat to analyze or extract details from open pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I install Genie Vision?">
    - Go to **Resources → Plugins**  
    - Download **Eye of ProgramGenie** for your browser (Edge or Chrome)

## Security & Access

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Yes. ProgramGenie encrypts all project data both in transit and at rest using enterprise-grade standards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I manage tokens and permissions?">
    Go to **Identity → Personal Access Tokens** to view or revoke API tokens linked to connectors or integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Who can access my project?">
    Only authorized workspace users. Admins can invite or remove members anytime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when a token expires?">
    Genie automatically disables syncing for that connector until a new token is added.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Genie log user actions?">
    Yes. Activity logs track key actions such as artefact edits, connector changes, and sync operations for compliance.
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting & Support

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="My connector fails to authenticate.">
    Verify that:
    - The email matches the token owner.  
    - The token is valid and unexpired.  
    - The account has necessary access rights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Artefacts aren’t generating as expected.">
    Ensure collateral is properly uploaded and categorized.  
    Re-run the generation process or try simplifying your prompt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can’t I see my artefacts in Jira or Zephyr?">
    Check that the connector is still active. If your token expired or permissions changed, reconnect the integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The interface is slow or unresponsive.">
    Refresh your browser and clear cache.  
    Large projects with thousands of artefacts may load slower — consider archiving older data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I contact support?">
    - Use the **Feedback** button inside ProgramGenie.  
    - Email [support@programgenie.ai](mailto:support@programgenie.ai).  
    - Enterprise customers can contact their account manager.
