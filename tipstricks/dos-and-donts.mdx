# Dos and Donâ€™ts

Hereâ€™s your Genie user checklist â€” simple rules that keep projects efficient, accurate, and secure.

<Grid columns="2">
  <Card title="âœ… DO">
    - Give Genie complete and clear context before asking for generation.  
    - Review generated artefacts before publishing to Jira.  
    - Use repositories to store and reuse verified artefacts.  
    - Invite cross-functional review before sign-off.  
    - Keep API tokens private and refreshed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="ðŸš« DONâ€™T">
    - Upload personal or confidential client data.  
    - Use Genie to replace expert judgment â€” always review.  
    - Mix multiple project domains in one workspace.  
    - Share your connector credentials.  
    - Ignore compliance or traceability steps.
