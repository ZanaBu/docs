# Working with Collateral

Your collateral is the DNA of your project. Genie reads everything — documents, screenshots, notes — to build structured, connected artefacts.

## Supported Input Types
| Type | Description | Pro Tips |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Documents** (DOCX, PDF) | Requirements, RFPs, reports | Use clear section headers and remove duplicates. |
| **Images** (PNG, JPG) | Screens, mockups, wireframes | Add readable labels and ensure good resolution. |
| **URLs / Links** | Online docs, pages | Use focused links (avoid entire websites). |
| **Audio / Video** | Meetings, interviews | Trim clips to relevant parts for faster analysis. |

## Upload Best Practices
- Group related content — one theme per upload.  
- Name files descriptively (e.g., “Portal_UI_Requirements_v3”).  
- Add notes or summaries for context.  
- Avoid mixing unrelated project types.  
- Reuse collateral from repositories for consistent style.

<Note>Good collateral saves hours later. Genie can only be as smart as the input you give it.</Note>
