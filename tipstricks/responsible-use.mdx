ProgramGenie helps teams innovate faster — but great power needs great responsibility.  
These guidelines keep your use of Genie ethical, compliant, and professional.

## Data Privacy
- Never upload personal data, client secrets, or regulated content.  
- Use anonymized or redacted examples when testing.  
- Store sensitive materials in private repositories only.  
- Always follow GDPR or your organization’s local data policy.

## Compliance
- Tag compliance-critical artefacts (e.g., GDPR, ISO, PCI DSS).  
- Maintain full traceability from requirement → test → delivery.  
- Export logs during audits to show AI traceability.  
- Use version locks for approved artefacts.

## Ethical AI Use
- Be transparent: disclose AI-assisted content in proposals or documentation.  
- Validate all AI outputs with human review before delivery.  
- Never use Genie to generate false or misleading artefacts.
