# Best Practices

ProgramGenie works best when your inputs are clear, structured, and purposeful.  
Here are expert tips to make your outputs more accurate, consistent, and valuable.

## 🧠 Understanding Genie’s Workflow

ProgramGenie operates best when you guide it like a skilled team member. It needs context, direction, and feedback. The clearer your input, the better the output.

<Tip>Think of Genie as your AI analyst — not just a generator. Feed it the same clarity you’d give a colleague.</Tip>

## 📄 Input Preparation

- Use **structured, specific** language. Avoid vague prompts like “generate requirements for a portal.” Instead: “generate requirements for a citizen self-service portal that handles uploads, verification, and notifications.”
- Upload **relevant collateral** together (docs, screenshots, URLs). Genie performs cross-reference checks.
- Keep **one domain per project** to avoid context blending.
- Use **consistent document naming** (e.g., “MobileBanking_v2_Requirements.pdf”).

<Note>Garbage in, garbage out — clean input equals professional output.</Note>

## ⚙️ Workflow Efficiency

- **Start broad, refine fast:** Begin with high-level artefacts, then use Genie Chat to expand epics and tests.
- **Iterate instead of redoing:** Use “Regenerate” or “Refine” instead of starting new projects.
- **Sync early:** Push to Jira once your first iteration is stable.
- **Leverage Repositories:** Reuse verified artefacts for speed and consistency.

<Tip>Genie thrives in iterative cycles — it gets better every round you do.</Tip>

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

- **Share early:** Invite feedback before publishing to external tools.
- **Assign ownership:** One team member per artefact type ensures accountability.
- **Document rationale:** Add comments for why requirements were created a certain way.
- **Link QA early:** Involve testers in story review to ensure coverage.

<Note>Genie creates alignment when teams collaborate around shared artefacts — not scattered files.</Note>
