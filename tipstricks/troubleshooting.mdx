If something isn’t working as expected, use this section as your quick guide.  
Below are the most common issues users encounter — and how to fix them.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="❌ My project won’t sync with Jira">
    Check your **Jira API token** — expired or mismatched tokens are the #1 cause.  
    Go to Jira → Profile → Security → API Tokens → Regenerate Token, then reconnect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="📄 My document upload failed">
    - Confirm file format: PDF, DOCX, TXT, or PNG are supported.  
    - Ensure file size < 20MB.  
    - Avoid special characters in filenames.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🧩 Genie isn’t generating stories or test cases">
    Make sure you’ve uploaded at least one **structured input** (document, notes, or transcript).  
    Genie needs business context before creating technical artefacts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔄 My updates in Genie aren’t appearing in Jira">
    Click **Resync Project**. If still missing, check Jira permissions — your account must have write access to create/edit tickets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🖼 Genie Vision misreads my screenshot">
    Upload higher-resolution or annotated versions — labels, spacing, and color contrast improve detection.
