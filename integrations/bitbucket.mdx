## What is Bitbucket
Bitbucket is Atlassian’s Git-based platform for source code management and software collaboration.  
It provides private repositories, pull request reviews, and integrated issue tracking — enabling teams to plan, build, test, and deploy together.

With the **ProgramGenie Bitbucket Connector**, generated artefacts like requirements, stories, and test cases can be automatically published into Bitbucket’s issue tracker.  
This ensures seamless alignment between business requirements and engineering delivery pipelines.

### TL;DR
- **Bitbucket** manages repositories, issues, and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically creates structured artefacts (requirements, stories, test cases) and syncs them into Bitbucket Issues.  
- **Integration** unifies documentation and development workflows, reducing manual effort.

In short: **Genie defines, Bitbucket delivers — together, they code smarter.**

## Why Integrate ProgramGenie with Bitbucket?

- **End-to-End Traceability:** Link generated requirements, user stories, and test cases directly to Bitbucket issues.  
- **Frictionless Collaboration:** Analysts, testers, and developers stay aligned across Genie and Bitbucket.  
- **Real-Time Sync:** Changes in Genie immediately reflect in Bitbucket, eliminating version gaps.  
- **Enhanced Governance:** Keep technical artefacts, documentation, and code branches in sync under one ecosystem.  
- **Improved Developer Focus:** Developers receive clear, AI-generated issue descriptions directly in Bitbucket.

<Info>
To connect ProgramGenie with Bitbucket, you’ll need **write access** to a repository and a **Bitbucket App Password** (used for secure authentication).

To establish the integration between ProgramGenie and Bitbucket, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Choose **Bitbucket** from the list of available connectors in ProgramGenie.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Give your connector instance a descriptive name, such as “Bitbucket – QA Integration”.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe the purpose of this connector (e.g., “Publishes generated test cases to Bitbucket issue tracker”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workspace & Repository">
    Enter your Bitbucket **Workspace ID** and **Repository name**.  
    Example: `myworkspace/my-repository`
  </Step>
  <Step title="App Password Authentication">
    Bitbucket uses **App Passwords** for secure API access.  
    Follow these steps to generate one:

    - In Bitbucket, go to **Personal settings → App passwords**.  
    - Click **Create app password**.  
    - Give it a name (e.g., “ProgramGenie Integration”).  
    - Enable the following permissions:
      - **Repositories:** Read and Write  
      - **Issues:** Read and Write  
      - **Pull requests:** Read (optional)
    - Copy the generated password — Bitbucket will show it only once.  
    - In ProgramGenie, enter:
      - Your **Bitbucket email address (username)**.  
      - The **App Password** generated above.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** App Passwords are user-specific. If deleted or revoked, ProgramGenie will lose access until a new one is added.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Use separate Bitbucket accounts or app passwords for different environments (e.g., Production vs. Testing) to maintain clean permission boundaries.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Issue Mapping">
    Define how Genie artefacts map to Bitbucket issues:
    - Requirements → “Task”  
    - User Stories → “Story”  
    - Test Cases → “Bug” or “Test” (depending on your workflow)  
    ProgramGenie will create and tag these automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Example Workflow

1. A product brief is generated in Genie.  
2. Genie converts the requirements into structured user stories.  
3. Each story is automatically synced as a Bitbucket issue under your selected repository.  
4. Developers can view, update, and link commits or branches directly from those issues.  
5. Any updates or edits in Genie reflect in Bitbucket — maintaining continuous alignment.

## Troubleshooting (Bitbucket Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails during setup.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect workspace, repository name, or invalid App Password.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify your workspace and repository values match your Bitbucket URL.  
    - Ensure the App Password includes **Repositories (Read & Write)** and **Issues (Read & Write)** permissions.  
    - Re-enter your email and password and try again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I get a '401 Unauthorized' error.">
    **Cause:** Invalid credentials or expired App Password.  
    **Solution:**
    - Recreate the App Password and reconnect the integration.  
    - Double-check that the account used has write access to the target repository.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issues are not showing up in Bitbucket.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect mapping or permission restrictions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Confirm issue tracking is **enabled** in your Bitbucket repository settings.  
    - Recheck artefact mapping and connector configuration in ProgramGenie.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes made in Genie aren’t updating Bitbucket issues.">
    **Cause:** The sync service is paused or the App Password was revoked.  
    **Solution:**
    - Click “Resync” in ProgramGenie.  
    - Reconnect using a new App Password if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labels or categories appear incorrectly.">
    **Cause:** Custom issue types or naming differences.  
    **Solution:**
    - Update mapping settings in Genie to match your Bitbucket issue types.  
    - Re-sync the project.
  </Accordion>

## FAQ (Bitbucket Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does ProgramGenie need a Bitbucket App Password?">
    Bitbucket requires App Passwords for secure API access — this allows ProgramGenie to create and update issues without storing your actual password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple users connect to the same repository?">
    Yes. Each user can create their own App Password tied to their account for independent authentication and audit tracking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my App Password is deleted?">
    ProgramGenie will stop syncing until a new valid App Password is provided.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does ProgramGenie modify existing Bitbucket issues?">
    ProgramGenie only updates or links issues it originally created — it will not alter unrelated issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does ProgramGenie sync with Bitbucket?">
    Syncing happens automatically whenever artefacts are generated or updated in Genie.  
    Manual syncs can also be triggered from the connector screen.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Bitbucket permissions are required?">
    You need **Write access** to the repository and **permission to create issues**.  
    Admin rights are not required.
  </Accordion>
