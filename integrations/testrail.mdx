## What is TestRail
TestRail is a leading web-based test management tool that helps QA teams organize, track, and analyze testing activities.  
By connecting **ProgramGenie** to TestRail, your generated test cases and related artefacts can be automatically published and kept in sync within your TestRail projects.

This ensures consistency between design, testing, and reporting — with no manual exports or duplicated work.

### TL;DR
- **TestRail** organizes test cases, runs, and results for efficient QA management.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically generates structured test artefacts and syncs them to TestRail in real time.  
- **Integration** maintains traceability between requirements, stories, and executed test cases.

In short: **Genie generates, TestRail validates — together, they assure quality.**

<Info>
Before connecting, make sure you have access to your TestRail instance and permission to create or edit test cases.  
You will also need to generate an **API Key (Token)** under your TestRail account.

## Key Benefits of TestRail Integration

- **Seamless Test Case Sync:** Automatically push generated test cases and suites from Genie into TestRail projects.  
- **Real-Time Updates:** Modifications in Genie (e.g., test descriptions or steps) reflect instantly in TestRail.  
- **Traceability:** Maintain linkage from requirement → user story → test case → execution result.  
- **Faster QA Cycles:** Eliminate the need to manually export or import cases.  
- **Better Reporting:** Genie-generated artefacts align directly with TestRail’s run and dashboard analytics.

To connect TestRail with ProgramGenie, configure the connector as follows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Choose **TestRail** from the list of available connectors in ProgramGenie.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a unique name for the connector instance (e.g., “TestRail – QA Automation”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe this connector (e.g., “Publishes Genie-generated test cases to TestRail Project X”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain">
    Enter your TestRail domain — for example:  
    `https://companyname.testrail.io` or your custom TestRail Cloud URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Token (Key)">
    TestRail requires a user-specific API token for secure integration.

    - In TestRail, click your **User Icon → My Settings → API Keys**.  
    - Click **Add Key** and give it a name (e.g., “ProgramGenie Integration”).  
    - Copy the generated key.  
    - Paste it into the **Token** field in the ProgramGenie connector screen.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** Tokens are personal credentials. If they are deleted or expired, ProgramGenie will stop syncing until a new one is added.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Assign descriptive names to your keys (e.g., “QA Connector – 90 Days”) and review them regularly to maintain security.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email / Username">
    Enter the TestRail account email used to generate the API key.  
    This user must have permission to create and edit test cases within the selected project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Key">
    Provide the **Project Key** corresponding to the target TestRail project where test cases should be synced.  
    Example: `QA01` or `WEBAPP`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Workflow

1. Genie generates test cases automatically from your requirements or user stories.  
2. The TestRail connector syncs these cases into your designated TestRail project.  
3. QA teams execute the tests, record results, and track coverage within TestRail.  
4. Updates, edits, or regenerations in Genie are automatically mirrored back to TestRail.

## Troubleshooting (TestRail Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails when authenticating with TestRail.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect domain, token, or email.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify your TestRail URL matches your workspace (e.g., `https://company.testrail.io`).  
    - Confirm the token and email belong to the same user.  
    - Recreate the API key if necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I get a '401 Unauthorized' or 'Forbidden' error.">
    **Cause:** Invalid credentials or missing permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Ensure the TestRail user has API access enabled.  
    - Check that the API key is still active.  
    - If using SSO, ensure API access is allowed for your account.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test cases are not appearing in TestRail.">
    **Cause:** Wrong Project Key or restricted permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify that the project key exists and is active in TestRail.  
    - Make sure the connected user has permission to add test cases.  
    - Re-sync the connector.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes in Genie are not updating in TestRail.">
    **Cause:** Token expired or sync paused.  
    **Solution:**
    - Generate a new API key and update the connector.  
    - Click **Resync** in Genie’s connector panel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test runs are not updating correctly.">
    **Cause:** TestRail run IDs not linked correctly.  
    **Solution:**
    - Check that the TestRail run is active.  
    - Refresh the mapping in Genie and resync results.

## FAQ (TestRail Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does ProgramGenie need my TestRail API key?">
    The API key allows Genie to securely create, update, and synchronize test cases in your TestRail workspace without storing your password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple users connect to the same TestRail project?">
    Yes, but each user should connect using their own TestRail credentials and API key to maintain access control and traceability.
