## What is Azure DevOps (ADO)
Azure DevOps (ADO) is Microsoft’s platform for end-to-end software delivery — from planning and tracking work items to managing code, pipelines, and releases.

With ProgramGenie’s ADO connector, all generated artefacts — requirements, user stories, and test cases — are automatically published and kept in sync inside your Azure Boards.  
This ensures every team member works from a single, consistent source of truth across the SDLC.

### TL;DR
- **Azure DevOps** provides integrated tools for agile planning, code collaboration, and CI/CD.  
- **ProgramGenie** generates structured project artefacts (requirements, stories, tests) and syncs them directly to Azure Boards.  
- **Integration** ensures instant traceability between business requirements and technical delivery, eliminating manual updates.

In short: **Genie generates, ADO tracks — together, they deliver.**

<Info>
Before connecting, ensure you have access to your Azure DevOps organization and permission to create and edit work items and projects.  
ProgramGenie uses your Personal Access Token (PAT) for secure authentication.

## Key Benefits of ADO Integration

- **Unified Planning:** All generated artefacts flow directly into your Azure Boards — no copy-paste or import steps.  
- **Real-Time Sync:** Updates in Genie instantly appear in ADO, ensuring both systems stay aligned.
- **Traceability:** Each ADO work item maps back to its original Genie artefact, maintaining a full audit trail.
- **Cross-Tool Collaboration:** Business analysts and testers use Genie for generation, while developers manage progress in ADO.
- **Governance & Reporting:** ADO dashboards can report on Genie-generated artefacts automatically.
- **Scalable Projects:** Works across multiple projects and teams within the same Azure DevOps organization.

## Connecting ProgramGenie to Azure DevOps (Setup Guide)

To integrate ProgramGenie with Azure DevOps, configure the connector using your ADO organization URL and Personal Access Token (PAT).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select **Azure DevOps** as the product to integrate with ProgramGenie.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a descriptive name for the connector instance (e.g., “ADO – Product Delivery”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe the purpose of this connector (e.g., “Syncs requirements and tests with ADO Project X”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Organization URL">
    Enter your Azure DevOps organization URL, for example:  
    `https://dev.azure.com/your-organization/`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personal Access Token (PAT)">
    The PAT allows ProgramGenie to authenticate securely with Azure DevOps.

    - In Azure DevOps, go to **User Settings → Personal Access Tokens**.
    - Click **New Token**.
    - Name it (e.g., “ProgramGenie Integration”) and set an expiry date (recommended 90 days).
    - Under **Scopes**, select **Work Items (Read & Write)** and **Project & Team (Read)**.
    - Create the token and copy the generated string.
    - Paste it into the ProgramGenie ADO connector screen along with your Organization URL.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** PATs are user-specific and expire automatically.  
    When your token expires or is revoked, ProgramGenie will stop syncing until you add a new one.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Use short-lived tokens and renew them periodically for better security hygiene.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Name">
    Select or enter the name of the Azure DevOps project where you want artefacts to sync.  
    ProgramGenie will automatically create corresponding work items if they don’t exist.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Work Item Types Mapping">
    Map Genie artefacts to ADO work item types (e.g., Requirement → Feature, Story → User Story, Test Case → Test Case).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting (ADO Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails when authenticating with Azure DevOps.">
    **Cause:** Invalid Organization URL or expired Personal Access Token.  
    **Solution:**
    - Confirm the Organization URL matches your ADO Cloud domain (`https://dev.azure.com/your-org/`).
    - Generate a new PAT with proper scopes and re-enter it in ProgramGenie.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I receive an 'Unauthorized' (401) error.">
    **Cause:** The PAT doesn’t have required permissions or belongs to another account.  
    **Solution:**
    - Ensure the token scope includes “Work Items (Read & Write)”.
    - Verify that the PAT owner has access to the selected project.
    - Try re-authenticating with a new token.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Work items are not appearing in ADO after sync.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect project mapping or insufficient permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Check that the Project Name matches exactly the target ADO project.
    - Verify that your PAT user has create-item rights.
    - Re-sync the project from Genie’s connector panel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes in Genie aren’t reflected in ADO.">
    **Cause:** The auto-sync process is paused or the PAT expired.  
    **Solution:**
    - Click “Resync” in ProgramGenie or reconnect the integration.
    - If still stuck, check whether your PAT is active under Azure DevOps Settings → Personal Access Tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mapping errors between Genie artefacts and ADO work items.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect work item type mapping.  
    **Solution:**
    - Go to connector settings and ensure artefact types align (e.g., Story → User Story).
    - Save changes and retry sync.
  </Accordion>
