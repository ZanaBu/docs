## What is GitLab
GitLab is an integrated DevOps platform that provides version control, CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and project management — all in one place.

By connecting ProgramGenie with GitLab, you can automatically push generated artefacts such as requirements, user stories, and test cases into GitLab Issues or Epics.  
This creates a single, automated workflow that links business requirements from Genie to development tasks in GitLab.

### TL;DR
- **GitLab** helps teams collaborate on code, issues, and CI/CD pipelines in one ecosystem.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically generates structured artefacts (requirements, user stories, tests) and syncs them to GitLab projects.  
- **Integration** ensures traceability between business and development without manual duplication.

In short: **Genie creates, GitLab builds — together, they deliver.**

<Info>
Before connecting, ensure you have access to your GitLab workspace with permission to create and manage issues or epics.  
ProgramGenie uses your **Personal Access Token (PAT)** for secure communication with GitLab’s REST API.

## Key Benefits of GitLab Integration

- **Automated Sync:** Genie’s generated artefacts (requirements, stories, and test cases) are automatically pushed as GitLab issues.  
- **Cross-Team Visibility:** PMs and QA teams work in Genie, while developers manage linked issues in GitLab.  
- **Full Traceability:** Each GitLab issue references its original Genie artefact, ensuring auditability and accountability.  
- **Instant Updates:** Changes in Genie are reflected in GitLab in real time — no spreadsheets or manual imports.  
- **Scalable Setup:** Works across multiple repositories and groups within the same GitLab instance.  
- **Improved Governance:** Centralizes project management, requirements, and code discussions under one connected ecosystem.

## Connecting ProgramGenie to GitLab (Setup Guide)

/>

To connect GitLab with ProgramGenie, you’ll configure the connector using your GitLab instance URL and Personal Access Token (PAT).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select **GitLab** as the integration product in ProgramGenie.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a descriptive name for the connector (e.g., “GitLab – Engineering Integration”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally, describe this connector (e.g., “Syncs user stories and tests with GitLab Project A”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Instance URL">
    Enter your GitLab instance URL.  
    For GitLab Cloud: `https://gitlab.com`  
    For self-hosted GitLab: use your internal domain (e.g., `https://gitlab.yourcompany.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personal Access Token (PAT)">
    The PAT authenticates ProgramGenie to securely access GitLab on your behalf.

    - In GitLab, go to **User Settings → Access Tokens**.
    - Click **Create Personal Access Token**.
    - Add a descriptive name (e.g., “ProgramGenie Integration”) and set an expiry date (recommended: 90 days).
    - Under **Scopes**, select:
      - `api` – for full API access.
      - `read_user` – to validate user details.
      - `write_repository` – to create and update issues.
    - Click **Create personal access token** and copy the generated string.
    - Paste the token into the ProgramGenie connector screen along with your instance URL.

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Use separate tokens for different projects or environments (e.g., UAT, Production) to simplify management and security rotation.
    </Note>

    <Warning>
    **Important:** GitLab PATs are personal credentials. Do not share them.  
    Once a token expires or is revoked, ProgramGenie will stop syncing until it’s replaced.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project ID">
    Enter the **GitLab Project ID** where artefacts should sync.  
    You can find it on your GitLab project homepage (usually below the project name).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mapping">
    Map Genie artefact types to GitLab entities:  
    - Requirements → Epics or Issues  
    - Stories → Issues  
    - Test Cases → Issues (with label `QA` or `Test`)  
    ProgramGenie will maintain consistent mapping across future syncs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting (GitLab Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My GitLab connection fails during setup.">
    **Cause:** Invalid instance URL or incorrect Personal Access Token.  
    **Solution:**
    - Ensure the token was generated with the required scopes (`api`, `read_user`, `write_repository`).  
    - Confirm your instance URL is correct (e.g., `https://gitlab.com` or self-hosted domain).  
    - Recreate the token and try reconnecting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I get a '401 Unauthorized' error.">
    **Cause:** The token may have expired or belongs to a user without sufficient permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Generate a new PAT and make sure it’s associated with an account that has access to the target project.  
    - Reconnect the integration from the ProgramGenie dashboard.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Artefacts are not appearing in GitLab after syncing.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect Project ID or missing permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify the Project ID entered in Genie matches your GitLab project’s numeric ID.  
    - Check the PAT’s scopes and confirm it has issue creation rights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes in Genie aren’t showing up in GitLab.">
    **Cause:** The sync service paused or the PAT expired.  
    **Solution:**
    - Click “Resync” in ProgramGenie.  
    - Reconnect using a fresh PAT if necessary.  
    - Check your token validity in GitLab → Access Tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labels or issue types look incorrect in GitLab.">
    **Cause:** Mapping configuration mismatch.  
    **Solution:**
    - Review your mapping settings inside Genie’s GitLab connector.  
    - Adjust how Genie artefacts correspond to GitLab issues or labels, then re-sync.
  </Accordion>
