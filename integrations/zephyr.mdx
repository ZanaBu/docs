## What is Zephyr
Zephyr is a powerful test management solution for Jira, enabling QA teams to plan, execute, and track manual and automated tests directly within their development workflow.

By integrating ProgramGenie with Zephyr, you can automatically push generated test cases and test cycles from Genie into Zephyr — keeping your testing documentation and execution status synchronized in real time.

### TL;DR:
- **Zephyr** helps QA teams manage and execute tests within Jira.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically generates detailed test cases and test cycles from requirements and user stories.  
- **The integration** ensures end-to-end traceability between requirements, tests, and defects.

In short: **Genie creates, Zephyr validates — together, they assure quality.**

## Why Integrate Zephyr with ProgramGenie
Connecting Zephyr with ProgramGenie provides QA teams and test managers with full alignment between generated artefacts and real-world execution.

- **Automated Test Case Sync:** All Genie-generated test cases are automatically pushed to Zephyr.  
- **Traceability from Requirement to Execution:** Each Zephyr test links back to its originating requirement or user story in Genie.  
- **Reduced Manual Work:** No more copy-pasting test descriptions or updating Jira manually.  
- **Unified Reporting:** Managers can view both generated coverage and actual test execution data directly in Jira’s Zephyr reports.  
- **Continuous QA Visibility:** Every requirement generated in Genie has a corresponding test asset in Zephyr, maintaining coverage metrics automatically.  
- **Faster Regression Testing:** As Genie regenerates or updates stories, Zephyr tests stay current.

<Info>
Before connecting, ensure your Jira instance includes the Zephyr app (Zephyr Squad or Zephyr Scale) and that your user account has permission to create and manage test cases.

## Connecting ProgramGenie to Zephyr (Setup Guide)

To start using ProgramGenie with Zephyr, you must connect Genie to your Jira instance where Zephyr is installed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select **Zephyr** as the product for integration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name">
    Assign a unique and descriptive name for this connector instance (e.g., “Zephyr – QA Management”).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe what this connector will do (e.g., “Syncs Genie-generated test cases to Zephyr Squad”).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Domain">
    Enter your Atlassian Jira Cloud domain, for example: https://your-domain.atlassian.net.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Email and Token">
    ProgramGenie uses your Atlassian account email and API token to authenticate Zephyr access.

    - Go to Jira → **Profile → Account settings → Security tab**.  
    - Under **API Tokens**, click **Create and Manage API tokens**.  
    - Click **Create API Token**, name it (e.g., “ProgramGenie Zephyr Integration”), and set an expiry date.  
    - Copy the generated token and paste it into ProgramGenie’s Zephyr connector, along with your Jira email address.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** Use the same Jira account that has access to the Zephyr plugin.  
    If the token is generated from a different user or expires, syncing will stop until a new valid token is added.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Key">
    Provide the Jira project key linked to your Zephyr setup.  
    ProgramGenie will automatically associate generated test cases with this project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mapping">
    Choose what you’d like to sync:
    - Test Cases  
    - Test Cycles  
    - Execution Results  

    Genie will mirror your selection and update Zephyr accordingly after each generation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If your organization uses **Zephyr Scale**, ensure the project type is compatible. ProgramGenie currently supports both Zephyr Squad and Zephyr Scale for Jira Cloud.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting (Zephyr Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My Zephyr connection fails when trying to connect ProgramGenie.">
    **Cause:** The API token or user email may be invalid, expired, or lack Zephyr permissions.

    **Solution:**
    - Ensure your Jira user has access to the Zephyr app within the target project.  
    - Verify that the email matches the token owner.  
    - Re-generate the token if expired and reconnect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test cases are not appearing in Zephyr.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect project mapping or missing permissions.

    **Solution:**
    - Check that the Jira Project Key matches the one linked to Zephyr.  
    - Make sure your account has permission to create tests in Zephyr.  
    - Run a manual re-sync in ProgramGenie.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I get 'Unauthorized' or '401' errors during sync.">
    **Cause:** Jira rejected your authentication credentials.

    **Solution:**
    - Confirm that the API token belongs to the same account used for email authentication.  
    - Verify that Zephyr is installed and accessible for that Jira user.  
    - Reconnect with a valid token.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Execution results are not syncing from Zephyr to Genie.">
    **Cause:** API permissions or Zephyr Scale endpoints not accessible.

    **Solution:**
    - Verify your Zephyr plan supports API read/write.  
    - Contact your Jira admin to confirm API access is enabled.  
    - Retry syncing after verifying permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The connector stopped working suddenly.">
    **Cause:** Token expired or Zephyr plugin permissions changed.

    **Solution:**
    - Re-generate the API token in Jira.  
    - Confirm Zephyr app access and reconnect in Genie.
  </Accordion>

## FAQ (Zephyr Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does ProgramGenie need my Zephyr API access?">
    The connector uses your Atlassian API token to communicate securely with Zephyr inside Jira, allowing Genie to create, update, and synchronize test cases without exposing your password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does ProgramGenie modify existing Zephyr tests?">
    No. Genie only creates or updates tests it originally generated. Existing tests remain untouched.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple users connect to the same Zephyr project?">
    Yes, but each user should authenticate with their own Atlassian email and token for traceability and security.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my API token expires?">
    Syncing will pause until a new valid token is provided in ProgramGenie. You’ll see a “Connection expired” message.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What permissions are required for Zephyr integration?">
    You need permission to create, edit, and execute tests in the target Jira project where Zephyr is installed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does ProgramGenie sync with Zephyr?">
    Synchronization occurs automatically after artefacts are generated or updated. You can also trigger a manual sync anytime.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I disconnect or switch my Zephyr account later?">
    Yes. You can disconnect or change the integration anytime in ProgramGenie’s connector settings.
  </Accordion>
