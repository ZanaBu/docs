## What is GitHub
GitHub is the world’s leading platform for software collaboration — combining version control, project tracking, and automation in a single developer ecosystem.

The **ProgramGenie + GitHub** integration allows you to push generated artefacts (requirements, user stories, and test cases) directly into **GitHub Issues** under your selected repository.  
This bridges the gap between project documentation and development execution, keeping everything aligned from idea to delivery.

### TL;DR
- **GitHub** provides issue tracking, code management, and collaboration for software teams.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically generates structured artefacts and syncs them into GitHub repositories as issues.  
- **Integration** ensures real-time traceability between business intent and engineering work.  

In short: **Genie creates, GitHub manages — together, they build smarter.**

<Info>
Before connecting, ensure you have permission to create issues in your GitHub repository and access to generate a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the required scopes.

## Key Benefits of GitHub Integration

- **Automated Artefact Sync:** Generated requirements, stories, and test cases are automatically pushed as GitHub Issues.  
- **End-to-End Traceability:** Every issue in GitHub can be traced back to its originating artefact in Genie.  
- **Seamless Collaboration:** Analysts work in Genie, developers in GitHub — both stay in sync.  
- **Real-Time Updates:** Changes in Genie instantly reflect in GitHub, eliminating manual duplication.  
- **Project Transparency:** GitHub Boards can automatically track Genie artefacts, improving sprint visibility.  
- **Secure & Scalable:** Uses GitHub’s token-based API for authenticated and role-based integration.

Follow these steps to connect your GitHub account with ProgramGenie and enable automatic artefact synchronization.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select **GitHub** as the integration product in the ProgramGenie Connectors section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Provide a clear name for your connector instance (e.g., “GitHub – Engineering Workspace”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe this connector (e.g., “Syncs Genie artefacts with GitHub Issues in the API repository”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Repository">
    Enter the full repository path in GitHub format:  
    `organization-name/repository-name`  
    Example: `programgenie/platform-ui`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personal Access Token (PAT)">
    The GitHub PAT allows ProgramGenie to securely interact with your repository.

    - Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Fine-grained tokens**.  
    - Click **Generate new token** and select:
      - **Repository access:** Choose the repository you want to connect.
      - **Permissions:** Enable at least:
        - Issues → Read and Write
        - Metadata → Read-only
        - Contents → Read-only
    - Set an expiry date (recommended: 90 days).
    - Generate and copy the token.
    - Paste the token into the ProgramGenie GitHub Connector setup screen.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** PATs are personal credentials. Once expired or revoked, ProgramGenie will stop syncing until you provide a new token.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Use different tokens for separate repositories or environments to keep integrations organized and secure.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Default Issue Type or Label">
    Choose how ProgramGenie artefacts are represented in GitHub:
    - Requirements → Issues (label: “requirement”)
    - User Stories → Issues (label: “story”)
    - Test Cases → Issues (label: “test”)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting (GitHub Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails when setting up the GitHub connector.">
    **Cause:** Invalid repository path or expired token.  
    **Solution:**
    - Confirm the repository name matches the GitHub format (`org/repo`).  
    - Check the token scopes — it must include **Issues (Read & Write)**.  
    - If expired, create a new token and reconnect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I receive a '401 Unauthorized' error.">
    **Cause:** The PAT doesn’t have the required permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Ensure the token’s repository access includes the target repo.  
    - Enable “Issues: Read & Write” permission.  
    - Reconnect the integration with the correct token.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issues are not appearing in GitHub after syncing.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect repository mapping or insufficient permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Double-check the repository name and token scopes.  
    - Verify the connected user can manually create issues in that repository.  
    - Try re-syncing the project from ProgramGenie.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes made in ProgramGenie aren’t updating in GitHub.">
    **Cause:** Auto-sync paused or PAT expired.  
    **Solution:**
    - Click **Resync** in ProgramGenie.  
    - Check token expiry in GitHub → Developer Settings → Tokens.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labels or metadata look inconsistent.">
    **Cause:** Custom label mapping mismatch.  
    **Solution:**
    - Adjust the mapping configuration in Genie’s GitHub connector.  
    - Re-publish to refresh issue labels and status.
  </Accordion>

## FAQ (GitHub Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why does ProgramGenie need my GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)?">
    The PAT provides secure access for ProgramGenie to create and manage GitHub Issues without storing your password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple users connect to the same GitHub repository?">
    Yes. Each user can connect using their own PAT, ensuring proper permissions and visibility for each contributor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when the PAT expires?">
    ProgramGenie will stop syncing with GitHub until a new valid token is added in the connector settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does ProgramGenie overwrite existing GitHub Issues?">
    No. ProgramGenie only updates or links issues it originally created — it won’t modify unrelated issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does ProgramGenie sync with GitHub?">
    Synchronization happens automatically in near real time whenever artefacts are created or updated in Genie.  
    Manual syncs can be triggered anytime from the connector panel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What permissions are required in GitHub?">
    You need permission to **create and edit issues** within the connected repository.  
    If you’re part of an organization, confirm this with your repo admin.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I disconnect or reconnect my GitHub account later?">
    Yes. You can disconnect anytime in ProgramGenie settings and reconnect using a different account or repository.
  </Accordion>
