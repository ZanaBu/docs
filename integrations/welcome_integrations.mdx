ProgramGenie can integrate with a number of external products. The sections below describe the configuration required for each connector. Connectors can be configured when a project is created (optional) or added at a later point via the ‘Settings’ screen. It is possible to add multiple connectors of the same type, for example, to allow two Jira repositories to be available in the same ProgramGenie project. For Jira and Confluence connectors, if the repository defined in the configuration does not exist, ProgramGenie will automatically create it for the user.
