## What is Xray
**Xray** is a powerful test management app built for Jira that supports both manual and automated testing within the Atlassian ecosystem.  
It allows QA and development teams to manage requirements, plan tests, execute runs, and track coverage — all inside Jira.

With **ProgramGenie’s Xray connector**, you can automatically publish and synchronize generated test artefacts such as test cases, test plans, and results directly into Xray.  
This ensures a seamless bridge between design, testing, and delivery activities.

### TL;DR
- **Xray** manages manual and automated test cycles in Jira.  
- **ProgramGenie** automatically generates test cases, test runs, and results, pushing them directly into Xray.  
- **Integration** provides real-time traceability from requirements to test execution.

In short: **Genie generates, Xray validates — together, they ensure quality at scale.**

<Info>
Before connecting, ensure your Jira workspace has the Xray app installed and that you have permission to generate API keys and create issues within the target project.

Follow these steps to connect Xray to ProgramGenie.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select **Xray** from the list of available connectors in ProgramGenie.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a unique and descriptive name for your connector instance (e.g., “Xray – QA Validation”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally describe this connector (e.g., “Publishes Genie test artefacts to Jira Xray Project”).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain">
    Enter your Jira/Xray domain, for example:  
    `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API Token">
    Xray requires its own API Token, which you can generate within your Xray account.

    - In Jira, go to **Apps → Manage Your Apps → Xray → API Keys**.  
    - Click **Create API Key**.  
    - Give the key a descriptive name (e.g., “ProgramGenie Integration”) and click **Create**.  
    - Copy both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** displayed.  
    - Paste them into the corresponding fields in ProgramGenie’s Xray connector setup.

    <Warning>
    **Important:** The Xray token is separate from your Jira API token.  
    If it expires or is deleted, ProgramGenie will lose access until a new one is added.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
    **Tip:** Store your Client ID and Secret securely and regenerate them periodically for improved security.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email / Username">
    Enter the Jira account email associated with your Xray license.  
    This must match the user that generated the Xray API credentials and has permission to create and execute tests.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Key">
    Provide the **Project Key** for the Jira/Xray project where test cases and executions should be published (e.g., `QA01` or `MOBILE`).  
    ProgramGenie will automatically sync generated artefacts into this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Example Workflow

1. ProgramGenie generates test cases automatically from requirements or user stories.  
2. The Xray connector syncs them into your Jira/Xray project as Test issues.  
3. QA executes test runs in Xray — results and statuses are updated automatically.  
4. When test results are modified in Xray, they remain traceable to the originating artefacts in Genie.

## Troubleshooting (Xray Connector)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection fails when setting up Xray.">
    **Cause:** Invalid domain, credentials, or expired API token.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify your Jira domain (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`).  
    - Ensure your Xray API Client ID and Secret are valid.  
    - If expired, regenerate the credentials in Xray and reconnect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I receive a '401 Unauthorized' error.">
    **Cause:** The Xray API credentials or Jira email do not match.  
    **Solution:**
    - Confirm the Xray token belongs to the same account used in ProgramGenie.  
    - Check that your user has permission to create and update Test and Test Execution issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test cases appear duplicated in Xray.">
    **Cause:** Multiple syncs triggered for the same artefact.  
    **Solution:**
    - Avoid running parallel syncs for the same project.  
    - Use Genie’s “Resync” option instead of manually re-adding connectors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Generated test cases aren’t visible in Xray.">
    **Cause:** Wrong Project Key or missing permissions.  
    **Solution:**
    - Verify that the specified Project Key exists and is linked to Xray.  
    - Check your user role permissions in Jira/Xray settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test results or executions aren’t syncing back to Genie.">
    **Cause:** Integration paused or expired API token.  
    **Solution:**
    - Reconnect using fresh Xray API credentials.  
    - Check the ProgramGenie connector status and click “Resync”.
  </Accordion>

## FAQ (Xray Connector)
