## What is Jira
Jira helps teams plan, track, and deliver software efficiently.

With ProgramGenie integration, all generated requirements, stories, and test cases sync automatically into Jira — creating a seamless flow from idea to implementation.
### TL;DR:
- **Jira** is a project management and issue-tracking tool used by software teams to plan, track, and release products.
- **ProgramGenie** automates the creation of requirements, epics, user stories, and test cases directly from your project input. \
  When connected, Genie automatically syncs all artefacts with Jira — meaning your documentation, tasks, and tests are instantly available to every team member.
- **Jira integration** eliminates manual duplication, ensures full traceability, and keeps your SDLC consistent, compliant, and up to date.

In short: **Genie creates, Jira organizes — together, they deliver.**

<Info>Before connecting, make sure you have access to Jira Cloud and permission to create API tokens and projects. Without these permissions, the connection may fail.</Info>
## Key Benefits of Jira Integration
The Jira integration unlocks several powerful advantages that streamline delivery, enhance collaboration, and ensure every project stays accurate and up to date:

- **Seamless Artefact Sync:** Every requirement, user story, and test case generated in Genie can be automatically pushed to Jira. Updates in Genie are reflected in Jira in real time, ensuring both systems stay aligned.
- **Real-Time Updates:** When a change occurs — whether it's a new feature, a scope adjustment, or a bug fix — ProgramGenie instantly updates the related Jira items. No more copy-paste or version mismatches.
- **Full Traceability:** Maintain a clear chain from business intent to delivery. Each Jira ticket can be traced back to the originating Genie artefact, ensuring transparency for audits, reviews, and compliance checks.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Business analysts, developers, and testers can all work in their preferred tools — Genie for generation, Jira for execution — while staying perfectly in sync. This improves productivity and reduces miscommunication.
- **Visibility & Governance:** Managers and stakeholders can track all generated artefacts, progress, and quality metrics directly inside Jira. Genie's structured artefacts make sprint planning and reporting easier and more accurate.
- **Change Management:**  When a client requests a change — for example, "Change the app's color bar to blue" — Genie updates every related artefact automatically and syncs those changes to Jira instantly. Developers, testers, and managers see the update in seconds, maintaining alignment and reducing risk.

## Connecting ProgramGenie to Jira (Setup guide)

To start using ProgramGenie with Jira, you need to connect your Jira account and connect it to ProgramGenie platform. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select the product that ProgramGenie is to be integrated with — in this case, Jira.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a unique name for this connector instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally, describe the purpose of this connector instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain">
    Your Atlassian domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token">
    The Jira authentication token is used together with the email address to authorize ProgramGenie. How to generate the token?

    - The email address and the API token together identify and authorize the Jira account that ProgramGenie will use.
    - You (the Jira user) must generate the token yourself inside Jira — it’s like creating a temporary password specifically for ProgramGenie.
    - To generate it, follow these steps.
      - Go to your Jira profile → Account settings → Security tab.
      - Find API Tokens → Create and Manage API tokens.
      - Click Create API Token, name it (for example “ProgramGenie Integration”), and set an expiry date.
    - Jira then shows you the token — a long string of letters and numbers.
    - You copy that token and paste it into ProgramGenie’s Jira connector screen (alongside your Jira email).
    - From that moment, ProgramGenie can securely read/write Jira data until the token expires.
    <Info>**Important:** API tokens are personal and cannot be shared. Each user should generate their own token. If your token expires or is deleted in Jira, ProgramGenie will lose access automatically until a new one is added.</Info>
<Note>**Tip:** Use descriptive names and expiry dates for your tokens (e.g., ProgramGenie Integration – 90 days) to keep your integrations organized and secure.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email">
    Enter the Jira user’s email (usually the project lead). It must be the same user who generated the token and must have write access to create, edit, and delete Epics & Stories.<Warning>Note: The email you enter must match the one used to generate the API token. Using a different account will result in an “Unauthorized” error during connection.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Key">
    Provide a maximum ten-character alphanumeric key. Jira uses this as the prefix for issue keys (e.g., “ABCD” → “ABCD-23”). Use the existing project’s key, or a new unique key to have ProgramGenie create a project automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting (Jira Connector)
Here are some frequently asked questions and common issues with the Jira connector, along with steps to help you resolve them. Click on a question to see the answer.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My Jira connection fails when I try to connect ProgramGenie.">
    **Cause:** This usually happens if the email or API token is incorrect, expired, or doesn’t match the Jira account.

    **Solution:**

    - Verify that the email entered in ProgramGenie is the same one used to generate the Jira API token.
    - Check that the token hasn’t expired. If it has, create a new one in Jira → Profile → Account settings → Security → API Tokens.
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces when pasting the token.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I see an “Unauthorized” or “401” error.">
    **Cause:** Jira is rejecting the authentication credentials.

    **Solution:**

    - Ensure the API token belongs to the same user account as the email entered.
    - Confirm that the user has the correct Jira permissions (read/write access to the project).
    - Try re-generating the API token and reconnect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My project connected successfully, but artefacts aren’t appearing in Jira.">
    **Cause:** Incorrect project mapping or missing permissions. **Solution:**

    - Check that the selected Jira project key matches the one you want to sync with.

    - Re-sync the project from ProgramGenie.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changes made in ProgramGenie aren’t updating in Jira.">
    **Cause:** The auto-sync process might be paused or the Jira API rate limit reached. **Solution:**

    - If the issue persists, disconnect and reconnect the Jira integration.
    - For large projects, sync may take a few minutes to complete.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I can’t find the Jira project I want to connect.">
    **Cause:** The connected user may not have access to that project or it’s in a different workspace. **Solution:**

    - Ensure you’re selecting the correct Jira site (if your organization has multiple).
    - Ask your Jira administrator to grant project access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My token stopped working suddenly.">
    **Cause:** The token expired or was revoked in Jira. **Solution:**

    - Go to Jira → Profile → Security → API Tokens → Create and Manage Tokens and generate a new one.
