## What is Jira

Jira helps teams plan, track, and deliver software efficiently.

With ProgramGenie integration, all generated requirements, stories, and test cases sync automatically into Jira — creating a seamless flow from idea to implementation.

### TL;DR:

- **Jira** is a project management and issue-tracking tool used by software teams to plan, track, and release products.
- **ProgramGenie** automates the creation of requirements, epics, user stories, and test cases directly from your project input. \
  When connected, Genie automatically syncs all artefacts with Jira — meaning your documentation, tasks, and tests are instantly available to every team member.
- **Jira integration** eliminates manual duplication, ensures full traceability, and keeps your SDLC consistent, compliant, and up to date.

In short: **Genie creates, Jira organizes — together, they deliver.**

## Key Benefits of Jira Integration

- **Seamless Artefact Sync:** Every requirement, user story, and test case generated in Genie can be automatically pushed to Jira. Updates in Genie are reflected in Jira in real time, ensuring both systems stay aligned.
- **Real-Time Updates:** When a change occurs — whether it's a new feature, a scope adjustment, or a bug fix — ProgramGenie instantly updates the related Jira items. No more copy-paste or version mismatches.
- **Full Traceability:** Maintain a clear chain from business intent to delivery. Each Jira ticket can be traced back to the originating Genie artefact, ensuring transparency for audits, reviews, and compliance checks.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Business analysts, developers, and testers can all work in their preferred tools — Genie for generation, Jira for execution — while staying perfectly in sync. This improves productivity and reduces miscommunication.
- **Visibility & Governance:** Managers and stakeholders can track all generated artefacts, progress, and quality metrics directly inside Jira. Genie's structured artefacts make sprint planning and reporting easier and more accurate.
- **Change Management:**  When a client requests a change — for example, "Change the app's color bar to blue" — Genie updates every related artefact automatically and syncs those changes to Jira instantly. Developers, testers, and managers see the update in seconds, maintaining alignment and reducing risk.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Integration">
    Select the product that ProgramGenie is to be integrated with — in this case, Jira.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name">
    Create a unique name for this connector instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Description">
    Optionally, describe the purpose of this connector instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Domain">
    Your Atlassian domain, for example https://my-domain.atlassian.net.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token">
    The Jira authentication token is used together with the email address to authorize ProgramGenie. How to generate the token?

    - The email address and the API token together identify and authorize the Jira account that ProgramGenie will use.
    - You (the Jira user) must generate the token yourself inside Jira — it’s like creating a temporary password specifically for ProgramGenie.
    - To generate it, follow these steps.
      - Go to your Jira profile → Account settings → Security tab.
      - Find API Tokens → Create and Manage API tokens.
      - Click Create API Token, name it (for example “ProgramGenie Integration”), and set an expiry date.
    - Jira then shows you the token — a long string of letters and numbers.
    - You copy that token and paste it into ProgramGenie’s Jira connector screen (alongside your Jira email).
    - From that moment, ProgramGenie can securely read/write Jira data until the token expires.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Email">
    Enter the Jira user’s email (usually the project lead). It must be the same user who generated the token and must have write access to create, edit, and delete Epics & Stories.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Project Key">
    Provide a maximum ten-character alphanumeric key. Jira uses this as the prefix for issue keys (e.g., “ABCD” → “ABCD-23”). Use the existing project’s key, or a new unique key to have ProgramGenie create a project automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>
